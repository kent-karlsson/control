# ExtraMirroring-proposed-v2.txt
# Date: 2025-11-17

# This data file lists symbol characters that have the Bidi_Mirrored=No property
# value, for which there is another Unicode character that has a glyph that is
# the mirror image of the original character's glyph. Letter characters are mostly 
# excluded. Included are mathematical symbols, arrows and arrow-like symbols and
# other symbols. Arrows and arrow-like symbols were never given the Bidi_Mirrored=Yes
# property, though many are non-left-right symmetric and many of those already
# have a (left/right) "mirror" character encoded. Many of the more common arrows
# are used in mathematical and formal logic expressions. See also
# https://unicode.org/reports/tr9 HL 6.
#
# The bidi algorithm must NOT use the mirrors in this file
# for automatic mirroring at display time, it is for mirroring
# at EDIT time.
#
# The file contains a list of lines with mappings from code point(s) to (an)other
# code point(s) for character-based mirroring, extending BidiMirroring.txt. There
# are a number of would-be-mirrorable characters that do not have a mirror character.
#
# Each mapping line contains two fields, separated by a semicolon ('; ').
# Each of the two fields contains code point(s) represented as
# variable-length hexadecimal value(s) with 4 to 6 digits.
#
# This file was originally created by Kent Karlsson based on Unicode v.17.
