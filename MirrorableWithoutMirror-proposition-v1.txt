# Symbols that could be appropriate to mirror in some contexts,
# in particular in math expressions, but does not have a mirror
# character allocated, and thus need some other mechanism than
# character mirror replacement in order to get the mirror glyph.
# (For math expressions represented using control chars, using
# the MATH MIRROR SYMBOL control character is such a mechanism.
# Note also that the bidi algorithm *must not* be applied to
# math expressions (regardless of representation), only to math
# identifiers (variables, function names, ...) individually,
# thus mirroring symbols via the bidi algorithm does not apply.
# The same goes for programming language source code.)
#
# The bidi algorithm must NOT use the mirrors in this file
# for automatic mirroring at display time, it is for mirroring
# at EDIT time.
#
# The mirroring can be done for 'operator argument swap' (for
# whatever reason) or, more generally, text order reasons (also
# in plain text). Note that if an arrow glyph sematically refers
# to a physical direction, a mirroring based on text order reasons
# must not be done. (This comment applies also to ExtraMirroring.txt
# and indeed also to BidiMirroring.txt, but for the latter text
# order reasons dominate strongly. Authors must still be attentive
# regarding automatic mirroring, by the bidi algorithm, of symbols
# is not applied when not desired also in running text; indeed, that
# applies also to bidi reordering especially around symbols (S*,P*).)
#
# The file contains a list of lines with one code point each for
# character-based mirroring needing a mirror mechanism to mirror,
# since these characters do not have a mirror character.
