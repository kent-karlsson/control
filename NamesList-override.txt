@		C0 controls
@+		See also ISO/IEC 6429:1992 (ECMA-48, 5th ed.).
@+		Several C0 control characters have been generalised to user defined information separators and user defined device controls.
@+		The device controls (remaining Cc) would be generated from a keyboard via terminal emulators only
0000	<reserved>
	* never used as character, but used as terminator, filler, and value (not character) to signify "not set"
	* was NULL, replaced by SYNCHRONOUS IDLE as filler
	* should not occur inside a text; if it does anyway, replace by SUBSTITUTE
0001	START OF HEADING
	* part of a telegram-like protocol, that is since long is out of use
	* though line breaking, these three controls are NOT considered NLFs (newline function)
0002	START OF TEXT 
	* part of a telegram-like protocol, that is since long is out of use
	* can also be used within 'plain text math' expressions
0003	END OF TEXT 
	* part of a telegram-like protocol, that is since long is out of use
	* can also be used within 'plain text math' expressions
0004	END OF TRANSMISSION
	* device control commonly used for "flush input line buffer" in "cooked mode" 'character special' (tty) devices
0005	DEVICE CONTROL SIX
	* generalised from ENQUIRY (defunct), (EBCDIC and) ASCII semantics
0006	DEVICE CONTROL SEVEN
	* generalised from ACKNOWLEDGE (defunct), (EBCDIC and) ASCII semantics
0007	ALERT BELL
	= BELL
	* name changed from "BELL" in order to avoid name clash with (bell - 1F514)
0008	CANCEL CHARACTER
	= BACKSPACE
	* U+0008 (mapped to any encoding that has this character) has been used for CANCEL CHARACTER for decades
	* true BACKSPACE, which does not erase anything, is now kept at U+0094
0009	CHARACTER TABULATION
	* was called horizontal tabulation (HT), but actually moves in the character progression direction
000A	LINE FEED 
	* (LF)
	* should be handled as an NLF regardless of system
	* sometimes called new line (NL) or newline
	* in output to terminals (only): may have different behaviour depending on tty mode
	x (next line - 0085)
000B	LINE TABULATION
	* was called  vertical tabulation (VT), but actually moves in the line progression direction
	* not an NLF despite the line break
	* should be preceeded by CR
000C	FORM FEED
	* (FF)
	* like LINE TABULATION, but moves to the next page if there is pagination
	* should be preceeded by CR
000D	CARRIAGE RETURN
	= (CR)
	* used as filler (to be inserted or removed as appropriate) in some encodings (in modern use)
	* when used as filler (mainly SMS/CBS, also when message is encoded in Unicode), it should not occur inside a text (if it does anyway, map to LF)
	* if not used as filler, should be combined with LF, VT or FF
	* is an NLF (Zp/B/BK) if not used as filler, nor if followed by LF, VT or FF (in which case the CR is BN/CM), but the pair CRLF is a (single) NLF
	* ((it is a far too common bug to (effectively) convert CRLF to LFLF))
000E	<reserved>
	* was LOCKING-SHIFT ONE, a.k.a. SHIFT OUT (older "multi-byte" charsets may still use this)
	* permanently reserved, no kind of code page switching is permitted in Unicode
000F	<reserved>
	* was LOCKING-SHIFT ZERO, a.k.a. SHIFT IN (older "multi-byte" charsets may still use this)
	* permanently reserved, no kind of code page switching is permitted in Unicode
0010	DEVICE CONTROL ZERO
	* user defined device control
	* generalised from DATA LINK ESCAPE (DLE); the standards for DLE have been withdrawn for several decades
0011	DEVICE CONTROL ONE
	* is commonly used for XON/start
0012	DEVICE CONTROL TWO
0013	DEVICE CONTROL THREE
	* is commonly used for XOFF/stop
0014	DEVICE CONTROL FOUR
0015	DEVICE CONTROL FIVE
	* generalised (to user defined device control) from NEGATIVE ACKNOWLEDGE, (EBCDIC and) ASCII semantics
	* each "DEVICE CONTOL n" is user defined
0016	INFORMATION SEPARATOR ZERO
	* user defined information separator
	* generalized from SYNCHRONOUS IDLE, (EBCDIC and) ASCII semantics, a time-filler information separator
0017	DEVICE CONTROL EIGHT
	* generalised (to user defined device control) from END OF TRANSMISSION BLOCK
	* sometimes used for CANCEL WORD (for some notion of 'word') in tty's
0018	CANCEL LINE
	= CANCEL
	* extent (char, word, line) was 'user defined', but char extent is already covered, word extent is loosely defined, but line extent is commonly supported for tty (settable via stty)
0019	DEVICE CONTROL NINE
	* generalised (to user defined device control) from END OF MEDIUM
001A	SUBSTITUTE
	* ideally decompose to (replacement character - FFFD)
	* mappings to older charsets, should map replacement character to SUBSTITUTE
	* this is an So, and should have a glyph (could be same or similar to that of replacement character, or indeed the ALT. SYMBOL FOR SUB)
	* ((make this and REPL.CHR. bidi B?))
	: FFFD
001B	ESCAPE
	* used for C1 character references (mainly when followed by an uppercase ASCII letter)
	* some uses for terminal (emulator) control functions (when followed by a lowercase ASCII letter)
	* never use for code page switching, which is not permitted in Unicode
	* most keyboards have an escape key, this may send an ESCAPE, though only via terminal emulators; an incoming(!) ESCAPE, from a keyboard/tty 'raw' mode, is often interpreted in ways not conforming to ISO/IEC 6429:1992 (ECMA-48, 5th ed.)
001C	INFORMATION SEPARATOR FOUR
	* generalised (to user defined) from  file separator (FS); (EBCDIC and) ASCII semantics
	* IS4 has user defined syntax/semantics, and is not necessarily part of a syntactic hierarchy
001D	INFORMATION SEPARATOR THREE
	* generalised (to user defined) from group separator (GS); (EBCDIC and) ASCII semantics
	* IS3 has user defined syntax/semantics, and is not necessarily part of a syntactic hierarchy
001E	INFORMATION SEPARATOR TWO
	* generalised (to user defined) from record separator (RS); (EBCDIC and) ASCII semantics
	* IS2 has user defined syntax/semantics, and is not necessarily part of a syntactic hierarchy
001F	INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE
	* generalised (to user defined) from unit separator (US); (EBCDIC and) ASCII semantics
	* IS1 has user defined syntax/semantics, and is not necessarily part of a syntactic hierarchy
	* these are the original "CSV" data format (using the ASCII semantics), but can be used also for other data formats
	* several other data formats ('user defined') can be INFORMATION SEPARATOR-based
	* ((quite worthy of a revival; .icsv, ...))

@		Control character
@+		See also ISO/IEC 6429:1992 (ECMA-48, 5th ed.).
007F	DEVICE CONTROL TEN
	* generalised from DELETE, which was eliminated from ECMA-48 5th edition (ISO/IEC 6429:1992)
	* there is a 'delete' key on most keyboards, but U+007F would be generated only via terminal emulators

@		C1 controls
@+		See also ISO/IEC 6429:1992 (ECMA-48, 5th ed.).
@+		Several C1 control characters have been generalised to user defined information separators and additions have been made for 'plain text math' expressions.
@+		With the sole exception of NEXT LINE no EBCDIC character maps to a C1 character.
@+		These characters are in general not generated directly via a keyboard.
@+		These do have ESC<uppercase ASCII letter, or certain symbols> character references, see ISO/IEC 6429:1992 (ECMA-48, 5th ed.), especially useful for charsets that do not have C1.
@+		(those ESC-char refs are not included below; separate proposal has been submitted to UTC)
0080	START OF MATH EXPRESSION
	* reserve for enabling a true 'plain text' math expression representation
0081	END OF MATH EXPRESSION
	* reserve for enabling a true 'plain text' math expression representation
0082	LINE BREAK PERMITTED HERE
	= BREAK PERMITTED HERE (BPH)
	* name clarification
	* ideally decompose to (zero width space - 200B)
	: 200B
0083	LINE BREAK NOT PERMITTED HERE
	= NO BREAK HERE (NBH)
	* name clarification
	* ideally decompose to (word joiner - 2060)
	: 2060
0084	MATH HORIZONTAL DIVISION
	* 0084 was for a very short while INDEX, a duplicate of LINE FEED, do not use in that capacity
	* reserve for enabling a true 'plain text' math expression representation, and within that the very common horizontal line layout for division
	* other common notations for division include plain SOLIDUS, and DIVISION SLASH and BIG SOLIDUS; DIVISION SIGN is mainly used only between numerals
	* note that this is an Sm, math symbol, acting as a (layout) control within a 'plain text' math expression
0085	NEXT LINE
	= (NEL)
	* ideally decompose into 000D 000A, but must have 0085 composition excluded
	: 000D 000A
0086	INFORMATION LEFT BRACKET ONE
	* generalised (to user defined opening bracket information separator) from START OF SELECTED AREA (block terminal semantics)
0087	INFORMATION RIGHT BRACKET ONE
	* generalised (to user defined closing bracket information separator) from END OF SELECTED AREA (block terminal semantics)
0088	<reserved>
	* was CHARACTER TABULATION SET
	* was called HORIZONTAL TABULATION SET
	* recommend to use another method of setting tab stops, one that does not need output for setting the stop
	* intended for faster form fillout in "line printers"/typewriter-like terminals, but using HT for ('poor-man's') column lineup is still common
	* HT is also used for such things as command completion, file name completion and similar, but that does not rely on tab stop settings
0089	CHARACTER TABULATION WITH JUSTIFICATION
	= (HTJ)
	* was called HORIZONTAL TABULATION WITH JUSTIFICATION
	* HT plus move the content of the preceding 'field' (back to previous HT/HTJ or b.o.l.) to end at the next tab stop
	* can be used for item list 'index' alignment, as well as (easier) numerical alignment
008A	<reserved>
	* was LINE TABULATION SET
	* was called VERTICAL TABULATION SET
	* recommend to use another method of setting tab stops, one that does not need output for setting the stop
	* intended for faster form fillout in "line printers"/typewriter-like terminals, but using VT like that is rare today
008B	PARTIAL LINE FORWARD
	* was primarily inteded to format superscripts/subscripts, but recommend using other methods
008C	PARTIAL LINE BACKWARD
	* was primarily inteded to format superscripts/subscripts, but recommend using other methods
008D	<control>
	= REVERSE LINE FEED
	* was for a short time called REVERSE INDEX
008E	<reserved>
	= SINGLE SHIFT TWO, still used in some encodings, in particular for 7-bit SMS/CBS (though not at 0x8E, but at 0x1B)
	* permanently reserved, no kind of code page switching is permitted in Unicode
008F	<reserved>
	= SINGLE SHIFT THREE
	* permanently reserved, no kind of code page switching is permitted in Unicode
0090	DEVICE CONTROL STRING
	* has been used for 'programming' function keys in terminals; obsolete
0091	INFORMATION SEPARATOR FIVE
	= PRIVATE USE ONE
0092	INFORMATION SEPARATOR SIX
	= PRIVATE USE TWO
0093	<undefined>
	* was SET TRANSMIT STATE, which was intended for (8-bit C1 chars) half duplex terminals, defunct
	* no reasonable generalisation, but not permanently reserved
0094	BACKSPACE
	* was CANCEL CHARACTER, but CANCEL CHARACTER is moved to 0008, since 0008 is actually used as CANCEL CHARACTER
0095	<undefined>
	* was MESSAGE WAITING, likely intended for half duplex terminals and manual intervention to change the transmit state (defunct)
	* no reasonable generalisation, but not permanently reserved
0096	INFORMATION LEFT BRACKET TWO
	* generalised (to user defined opening bracket information separator) from  START OF GUARDED AREA (block terminal semantics)
0097	INFORMATION RIGHT BRACKET TWO
	* generalised (to user defined closing bracket information separator) from  END OF GUARDED AREA (block terminal semantics)
0098	START OF STRING
	* 'generic' control string start; not used to date
0099	MATH MIRROR SYMBOL
	* reserve for enabling a true 'plain text' math expression representation
009A	SINGLE CHARACTER INTRODUCER
	* can be used to make another INFORMATION SEPARATOR from a (single char) INFORMATION SEPARATOR
	* can be used in 'plain text math expressions' to generate various math
009B	CONTROL SEQUENCE INTRODUCER
	* commonly used to do styling of text output to terminals
	* can be used for styling text also elswhere, e.g. in text files
	* note that there is a difference between a 'control sequence' and a 'control string'
	* the control sequence is terminated by an ASCII letter or an ASCII symbol not permitted inside the control sequence
009C	STRING TERMINATOR
	* terminates a control string (started by START OF STRING, OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND, PRIVACY MESSAGE, APPLICATION PROGRAM COMMAND)
009D	OPERATING SYSTEM COMMAND
	* commonly used in terminal emulators for setting window headings and other functions
009E	PRIVACY MESSAGE
	* used to set the content of a reserved status line in some older terminals; otherwise obsolete
009F	APPLICATION PROGRAM COMMAND
	* could potentially be used to embed "non-plain-text" (like images or vector graphics)
